#GPIO Hackathon!

----------


Resources for [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) GPIO Hackathon using basic electronics (Ã  la [CamJam](http://camjam.me/)'s [EduKit](http://camjam.me/edukit))

Session leader:

- David Bower [@rddave](https://twitter.com/rddave)

Session facilitators:

- Andy Melder [@SouthendRpiJams](https://twitter.com/SouthendRPiJams)


----------

In this **Scratch GPIO Hackathon**, teams of 2 or 3 young programmers will work together to make a Scratch project which interfaces with basic electronic inputs and outputs (similar to those found in [CamJam](http://camjam.me/)'s [EduKit 1](http://camjam.me/edukit)).

The electronic components available are:

- a red, green and yellow LED
- a push button(s)
- a buzzer (or a speaker could be used)
- resistors
   

## Resources

Programmers are provided with sheets covering the following topics:

- [ScratchGPIO Command Guide](http://simplesi.net/scratchgpio/visual-command-guide/) from [Simon Walters](https://twitter.com/cymplecy)

- [GPIO pinouts](http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout) from [Phil Howard](https://twitter.com/gadgetoid)

These *cheat sheet* resources are just to get those unfamiliar with the GPIO header and Scratch GPIO up and running.


### Additional resources that are available:

- [Introduction to the GPIO header](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) from the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://twitter.com/raspberry_pi)

- [Sean McManus](https://twitter.com/musicandwords) has created three starter example projects, Torch, FizzBuzz and Burglar Alarm (the last of these requires CamJam EduKit 2) here [www.sean.co.uk/books/raspberry-pi-for-dummies/scratch-gpio.shtm](http://www.sean.co.uk/books/raspberry-pi-for-dummies/scratch-gpio.shtm)  Code for these projects is available.

- [Scratch Cards](Scratch-1.4/ScratchCardsAll-v1.4-PDF) for any members of the group who are unfamilar with Scratch and who need a basic introduction.

- Example Scratch GPIO projects from the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/):

  - [Robot Antenna](http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/robot-antenna/worksheet/)
  - [Sweet Shop Reaction Game](http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/reaction-game/)

- [CamJam](http://camjam.me/) [EduKit 1](http://camjam.me/?page_id=236#download) Python worksheets.  These could be used be very able members of the group directly in Python, or as a challenge to convert to Scratch.


## WARNING!  GPIO Safety

It is **very important** that GPIO safety information is reviewed in the Introduction to the GPIO Header document - close attention must be paid to the correct connection of GPIO pins.  Permanent damage can be caused to the Raspberry Pi due to mis-connection of GPIO header pins.

For example, the power and ground pins should not be directly connected.  The different current value power pins should not be directly connected.  Current limiting resistors should be used in order to ensure LEDs are not damaged.  Etc.


## Saving

Remember to save your work, **frequently**!  Also remember to shut down the Raspberry Pi properly at the end of the session otherwise the SD card can become damaged!


## (Loose!) Session Plan

Item | Time | Task
--- | --- | ---
1 | 5 mins | Introduction and outline of the Scratch GPIO Hackathon - create something **amazing** out of Scratch, GPIO and a few basic electronic components!  **Hightlight important safety aspect of correctly connecting GPIO pins**
2 | 5 mins | Make some teams!  Self organised teams / different skills / different abilities.  Encourage teams to brainstorm ideas of what sort of **amazing** Scratch GPIO projects could be created!
3 | 10 mins | Basics of the electronic components.  Breadboard with no bread?  Which breadboard strips are connected?  Using the Adafruit T-Cobbler and jump out to another area of the breadboard.  Resistor and LED goes in pairs.  Are both sides of an LED equal?
4 | 1 hr 30 mins | **Hackathon!** 
4 | 30 mins | Show & tell.  What did you create?  What did you learn?  What would you do next to further extend the project? 
5 | 10 mins | Final save, proper shutdown of Pis!  


## Show & Tell

The workshop will finish with a **show & tell**!  Those teams that want (time permitting!) will be asked to give a brief summary of what they learnt and created!!

(Facilitator note:
If required, some sort of random selection of teams to present may be required, for example [www.classtools.net/random-name-picker](http://www.classtools.net/random-name-picker/) )


## Further Information / After the Event

Gordon Henderson has a basic GPIO example with a single LED where he details why a resistor is also needed, see [projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gpio-examples/tux-crossing/gpio-examples-1-a-single-led](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/gpio-examples/tux-crossing/gpio-examples-1-a-single-led)

If you want to document your Scratch GPIO creations, you could use [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) to draw out your circuits.


## Keep Us Updated!

Please do tell us what you have gone on to create in Scratch on your PC/Mac or Raspberry Pi, and with basic electronics using Scratch GPIO on the Raspberry Pi.

Our Twitter details for parents/carers to get in touch are shown at the top of this document.
